# MICrONS-datacleaner

[![License](https://badgen.net/#github/license/margheritapremi/MICrONS-datacleaner)](https://badgen.net/#github/license/margheritapremi/MICrONS-datacleaner)

This project contains tools to work with the [MICrONS Cortical MM3 dataset](https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3), providing a **robust interface** to interact with the nucleus data. 

## Key features 

- **Simple interface** to download and keep organized anatomical data via CAVEClient. 
- **Allows to query the synapse table in chunks** avoiding common pitfalls. 
- **Easily process nucleus annotation tables**. 
- **Automatically segment** the brain volume into cortical **layers.**
- **Tools for filtering** and constructing connectome subsets. 
- Basic interface to add functional properties, including **tuning curves and selectivity**. 

## Install

```bash
pip install microns-datacleaner
```

## Using the package

- **Few lines of code** to get a full table with neurons' brain area, layer, cell_type, proofreading information, and nucleus position:

```python
#Import the lib
import microns_datacleaner as mic

#Target version and download folder
cleaner = mic.MicronsDataCleaner(datadir = "data", version=1300, download_policy='minimum') 

#Download the data
cleaner.download_nucleus_data()

#Process the downloaded data and segment into layers
units, segments = cleaner.process_nucleus_data()
```

- **Filter easily!** How can we get all neurons in V1, layers L2/3 and L4 with proofread axons?

```python
units_filter = fl.filter_neurons(units, layer=['L2/3', 'L4'], proofread='ax_clean', brain_area='V1')
```

- **Robustly download synapses** between a subset of pre and post-synaptic neurons in chunks. 

```python
preids  = units_filter['pt_root_id']
postids = units_filter['pt_root_id']
cleaner.download_synapse_data(preids, postids)

#Connection problems at chunk number 23? Just restart from there
cleanerdownload_synapse_data(preids, postids, start_index=23)
```

## Citation Policy 

If you use our code, **please consider to cite the associated repository,** as well as the [IARPA MICrONS Minnie Project](https://doi.org/10.60533/BOSS-2021-T0SY) and the [Microns Phase 3 NDA](https://github.com/cajal/microns_phase3_nda) repository. 

Our code serves as an interface for the MICrONS data. Please cite appropiate the literature for the data used following their [Citation Policy](LINK). The papers may depend on the annotation tables used.

Our unit table is constructed by integrating information from the following papers:

## Generating the Docs 

## How to use 

(To be written)
See the `tutorial` notebook.

## Generating the docs

Go to the main folder of the repository, and run

```
pdoc -t docs/template source/mic_datacleaner.py -o docs/html
```

The docs will be generated in the `docs/html` folder in HTML format, which can be checked with the browser. If you need the docs for all the files, and not only the class, use `source/*.py` instead of `source/mic_datacleaner.py` above.
